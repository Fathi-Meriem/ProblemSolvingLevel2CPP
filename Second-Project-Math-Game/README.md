Math Game in C++
Project Description
This project is a C++ implementation of a Math Game that challenges players with arithmetic questions based on their selected difficulty level and mathematical operations. Players can customize the game by choosing:

Difficulty Levels: Easy, Medium, Hard, or Mixed.
Math Operations: Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/), or Mixed.
Number of Questions: Players can choose how many questions they want to answer.
The game provides feedback for each question:

Green Screen: Correct answer.
Red Screen: Incorrect answer, with the correct answer displayed.
At the end of the game, the total number of correct answers is evaluated:

Green Screen: High number of correct answers.
Red Screen: Low number of correct answers.
